## Tech-stack

Frontend: React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, has been used for building our frontend. JavaScript has been used as the main language for faster coding.

Backend: Django, a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. It takes care of much of the hassle of web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. 
Python has been used as the main backend language and MySQL used for the database.
